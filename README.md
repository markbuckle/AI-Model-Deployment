How to Deploy AI Apps to the Cloud with Flask &amp; Azure

Steps:
1. Set up a [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a Resource Group in the Azure Portal. A resource group helps you organize and manage resources based on their lifecycle and their relationship to each other. 
3. Create an App Service: An App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling your web apps.
4. Deploy via GitHub repo: In the Azure Deployment Center, connect your GitHub repository to your App Service. This will enable continuous integration and deployment, so your app will be automatically updated whenever you push changes to the specified branch. Make sure to select the correct branch.
